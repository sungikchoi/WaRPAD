# Code of Training-free Detection of AI-generated images via Cropping Robustness [NIPS 2025]

link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14030

## Requirements

### Environment setting

We refer to our library in requirements.txt. 

### Downloading Dataset

We use three benchmarks for the main experiment. Due to the size, we have provided a download link for the dataset. 

GenImage: http://github.com/GenImage-Dataset/GenImage

Synthbuster: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10334046 , https://loki.disi.unitn.it/RAISE/download.html
